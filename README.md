# Colormap Creator

A web-based tool for creating and editing colormaps, designed for use as an internal company tool. This application allows you to create custom colormaps with precise control over color stops and positions, and export them in formats compatible with Python visualization libraries.

## Features

- Interactive colormap editor with drag-and-drop color stops
- Add, remove, and edit color stops with precise control
- View color stop information in a tabular format
- Generate and view 512 RGB values for smooth gradients
- Export colormaps as JSON or Python code (compatible with PlotPy)
- Import previously saved colormaps from JSON
- Context menu for easy editing
- Mobile-responsive design

## Usage

### Creating a Colormap

1. When you first open the tool, a default black-to-white colormap is created
2. Click on the colormap bar to add new color stops
3. Drag color stops to adjust their positions
4. Double-click or right-click on a color stop to edit its color
5. Use the "Add Color Stop" button to add a stop at a precise position

### Saving and Loading

- Click "Save Colormap" to export as JSON or Python code
- Click "Load Colormap" to import a previously saved JSON colormap

### Viewing Data

- Switch between "Color Stops" and "512 RGB Values" tabs to view detailed information
- Each table shows the position, color, and RGB values

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Try the simplified test page: [Test Page](https://imad-miftek.github.io/colormap-creator/test.html)
3. See the troubleshooting guide: [How to Test](https://imad-miftek.github.io/colormap-creator/how-to-test.html)

## Technical Information

### How it Works

The colormap editor uses HTML Canvas for rendering and JavaScript for interactive functionality. Color interpolation is handled mathematically to ensure smooth gradients between color stops.

When exporting as Python code, the application generates code compatible with PlotPy's EditableColormap, making it easy to use in Python visualization projects.

### Used Libraries

- Chart.js - For rendering some UI elements
- JSColor - For the color picker functionality

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Edge 80+
- Safari 10+
